To make a bed you will need, at a minimum, the following items:
* 1 bottom sheet 
* 1 duvet
* 1 duvet cover
* 1 fitted sheet or flat sheet

Prior to making the bed ensure that you remove all bedding items from the mattress, leaving only the exposed mattress resting on top of the bed frame. Further, ensure you have all the listed items, they are clean and that they are of the correct dimensions to fit the bed's dimensions. 

Only when all prerequisites are satfisfied may you proceed with the following instructions.

Instructions:
-------------

Please note that step 1 is marked as optional [See Prerequisities](#Anchor1).

1) Obtain the mattress protector and place the side with the manufacturer tag down onto the mattress. 
   - a) Hold one of the four fasteners of the mattress protector.
   - b) Pull the fastener towards its matching corner of the mattress and tuck it tightly under that corner of the mattress.
   - c) Repeat steps a and b for each fastener.

2) Retrieve the fitted sheet or flat sheet.
    - a) Hold one of the four corners of the sheet.
    - b) Pull the corner towards its matching corner of the mattress and tuck it tightly under that corner of the mattress.
    - c) Repeat steps a and b for each of the other corners.

3) Obtain the top sheet and repeat the tasks outlined in  for the top sheet. 
   If required, apply pressure to any creases on the top sheet by placing the palm of your hand on a creased area and exert a 
   force suitable to remove the creases; next, examine each corner of the top sheet to ensure they are correctly tightly under 
   the mattress.

4) Locate the duvet and the duvet cover to enable you to make the fitted duvet. 
   - a) Place the duvet into the duvet cover.
   - b) Push each corner of the duvet into its matching corner of the duvet cover. 
   - c) Align the bottom of the duvet so that it does not hang outside the bottom of the duvet cover.
   - d) Fasten each button of the duvet cover taking care not to skip any of the buttons.

5) Place the sealed-button end of the fitted duvet towards the bottom of the mattress.
   - a) Check that the duvet overhangs evenly between the left and right side of the mattress. 
   - b) Move the bottom of the duvet downwards to enable a 6-inch gap to form from the top of the duvet to the head of the 
        bed.
   - c) Remove any creases similiar to the actions outlined in step 3. 

6) Take the edge of the top sheet at the top of the bed and neatly fold it over the top-edge of the fitted duvet. 

7) Retrieve the two pillows and two pillow covers.
   - a) Acquire the first pillow and place it into one of the pillow cases.
   - b) Fold the pillow flap over the pillow. 
   - c) Fluff the fitted pillow to evenly distribute the pillow contents. 
   - d) Repeat steps a to c for the second pillow and the remaining pillow case. 

8) Complete the action of making the bed by laying each pillow flat on the head of the bed; this fills the gap created between
   the top of the fitted duvet and the headboard of the bed.
