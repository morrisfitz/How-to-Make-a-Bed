# Goal:
--------

The goal of this document is to provide you with instructions that will enable you to make a bed, regardless of the bed's dimensions. 


# Prerequisites: 
--------------
A number of prerequisites must be followed prior to making the bed [Instructions](#bed-making-instructions).

## Necessary Materials

To make a bed you will need, at a minimum, the following items:
* 1 bottom sheet 
* 1 duvet
* 1 duvet cover
* 1 fitted sheet
* 2 pillows
* 2 pillow covers
* 1 mattress protector **(Optional)**
* 1 top sheet

Please ensure that the items listed are clean and that they are of the correct dimensions to fit the bed's dimensions. 

## Bed State

Prior to making the bed ensure that you remove all bedding items from the mattress, leaving only the exposed mattress resting on top of the bed frame. 



# Bed Making Instructions:
-------------

Please note that there is an optional instruction which can be considered, as per the [Prerequisities](#Prerequisites).

<details>
  <summary>Mattress Protector (Optional)</summary>
 Retrieve the mattress protector and place the side with the manufacturer tag down onto the mattress. 

   1. Hold one of the four fasteners of the mattress protector.
   2. Pull the fastener towards its matching corner of the mattress and tuck it tightly under that corner of the mattress.
   3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each fastener.

## Fitted Sheet 

Retrieve the fitted sheet and proceed through the following steps:

   1. Hold one of the four corners of the sheet.
   2. Pull the corner towards its matching corner of the mattress and tuck it tightly under that corner of the mattress. 
   3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each of the other corners. 

To verify a correct fit, examine each corner of the fitted sheet to ensure they are placed tightly under the mattress.
   
## Top Sheet 

Retrieve the top sheet and proceed through the following steps:

   1. Hold one of the four corners of the sheet.
   2. Pull the corner towards its matching corner of the mattress and tuck it tightly under that corner of the mattress. 
   3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each of the other corners. 

   If desired, apply pressure to any creases on the top sheet by placing the palm of your hand on a creased area and exert
   a force suitable to remove the creases. To verify a correct fit, examine each corner of the top sheet to ensure they are positioned  
   tightly under the mattress.

##  Duvet

Retrieve both the duvet and duvet cover and proceed with this section.

### Duvet Cover

Before the duvet can be applied, it must first be placed into a duvet cover for protection. This can be achieved by following these instructions:

   1. Place the duvet into the duvet cover.
   2. Push each corner of the duvet into its matching corner of the duvet cover. 
   3. Align the bottom of the duvet so that it does not hang outside the bottom of the duvet cover.
   4. Fasten each button of the duvet cover taking care not to skip any of the buttons.

You now have a fitted duvet and may proceed onto the [placement](#duvet-placement) of the duvet.

###  Duvet Placement

Taking the [fitted duvet](#duvet-cover), place the sealed-button end of the fitted duvet towards the bottom of the mattress. Proceed through the following steps to apply the duvet to the bed:

   1. Check that the duvet overhangs evenly between the left and right side of the mattress. 
   2. Move the bottom of the duvet downwards to enable a 6-inch gap to form from the top of the duvet to the head of the 
        bed.
   3. Remove any creases from the duvet by following the crease-removing technique outlined for the [top sheet](#fitted-sheet). 

## Sheet Presentation

Take the edge of the top sheet at the top of the bed and neatly fold it over the top-edge of the fitted duvet. 

## Pillow

Retrieve the two pillows and two pillow covers and proceed through this section

### Pillow Cover

 Before the pillows can be applied, they must first be placed into a pillow cover for protection. The following steps are to be followed:

   1. Acquire the first pillow and place it into one of the pillow cases.
   2. Fold the pillow flap over the pillow. 
   3. Fluff the fitted pillow to evenly distribute the pillow contents. 
   4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for the second pillow and the remaining pillow case. 

### Pillow Placement

Complete the action of making the bed by laying each pillow flat on the head of the bed; this fills the gap created between the top of the fitted duvet and the headboard of the bed.
